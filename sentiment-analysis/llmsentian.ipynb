      "- Review 1: ```A five-seater SUV with an amazing variety of features, the Tata Nexon is priced impressively between Rs. 7.80 to 14.50 lakhs*. It provides a wide range of customization possibilities with 65 versions, two engine choices, and two gearbox options. It is a well-liked option in its market thanks to its svelte look and strong performance. There is plenty of room for passengers and baggage in the Nexon's large cabin and 350-litre trunk. It can comfortably navigate rocky roads and terrain thanks to its 209 mm ground clearance. The Tata Nexon is a sleek and functional SUV for both families and adventurers, and it comes in nine appealing colours.''`\n",
      "- Review 2: ```The Tata Nexon is not as advertised. It doesn't have all the customization options mentioned in the reviews I read. It's disappointing when you see your friends driving other versions of the same SUV with more features. The ground clearance is not suitable for off-roading and it can be uncomfortable during bumpy rides.''`\n",
      "- Review 3: ```The Tata Nexon is a decent SUV, but nothing special. It's within my budget, and I like its look. However, it could use some additional customization options to make it stand out from other SUVs on the market. The ground clearance is good enough for city driving. Overall, it's just an average SUV.''`\n",

For example, 'doesn't have all the customization options mentioned in the reviews I read' contradicts with the positive sentiments, hence it's negative. \n",
